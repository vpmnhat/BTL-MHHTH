You can write the input in the INP file.
The format of input is as follows:

The first line is: 50 ( 50 nodes ), and the links are set up like the description in the report
The second line is: start point _ destination _ maximum time to rescue
The third line is: the number of people _ the time threshold
The fourth line is: number of scenarios
The fifth line is: probability of each scenario
The last line is: number of iterations for updating Lagrange multiplier

The output will evaluate the value of lower bound and upper bound of the optimization function and their relative gap, as well as produce the prior plan for each link.
